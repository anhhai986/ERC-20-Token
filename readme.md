# Solidity ERC-20 Token
Token with a fixed supply, initially held by a wallet under the owner's control. Tokens can be bought for Ether.

Modify the public variables, and choose an address to hold the initially issued tokens when deploying the contract.

Select the "My Advanced Token" contract when deploying. It will deploy an ERC-20 compatible, tradable token.
